## Data Collection
This project leverages the Netflix TV Shows and Movies dataset to analyze IMDb ratings and their distribution across various titles on the platform. The dataset offers detailed information, including title names, type, release year, age ratings, runtime, IMDb scores, and votes, ensuring a rich foundation for exploration. By examining these elements, I aim to uncover patterns in viewer ratings and assess the popularity and reception of Netflix content.

## Modeling
A Tree Classifier was used, a statistical approach that aims to find the relationship between a categorical attribute (response variable) and a set of predictor attributes. In the end, an accuracy of 67% was achieved.

## Conslusions 
* Over the years, more TV shows have been made than movies.
* The average IMDb ratings for TV shows are slightly higher than those for movies. The difference between the types remains consistent over the observed years, except in the years close to the 1990s.
* The growth in the number of movies and shows increases as the age certification becomes higher.
* The production rate of movies and TV shows is similar and increases significantly from 2010 onward, when the production of TV shows surpasses that of movies.
* Movies, being self-contained stories, have more flexibility in runtime to adapt to the narrative's needs, leading to the observed volatility. In contrast, TV shows typically adhere to standard broadcast slots, resulting in more consistent episode lengths.
* All of the top 10 titles are TV shows, with only 3 titles for adults.
* Terms related to family, girl, life, and love are more common, reflecting the type of stories that are most often created, that is, real stories where people see themselves.
